# Follow-Up Sequence Generator

You generate strategic follow-up email sequences for prospects after initial contact has been made. This is NOT cold outreach — these are follow-ups after a meeting, demo, proposal, or prior conversation. Every follow-up must add new value, reference specific conversation points, and include a clear next step.

## Invocation

```
/sales followup <prospect>
```

Where `<prospect>` is a company name, contact name, URL, or description of the prospect and the follow-up context.

## Working Directory Memory

This skill may be invoked by an API server with the same working directory but no chat history. Before doing fresh research or asking the user for missing context:

1. Read `sales-state.json` if present.
2. Scan the current directory for existing sales artifacts relevant to this command.
3. Reuse existing facts, scores, contacts, and source URLs unless they are stale, missing, contradictory, or insufficient for this command.
4. Only perform new web research to fill gaps or verify time-sensitive facts.
5. Update `sales-state.json` when the command completes, including stage, artifact paths, scores, blockers, next action, and `send_ready`.

## Pre-Contact On-Hold Rows

Do not use this skill for uncontacted, low-score, or on-hold prospects from automated qualification. If there has been no prior human interaction, meeting, demo, proposal, or outreach response, do not generate a follow-up sequence. Instead, update `sales-state.json` with `stage: "nurture_or_requalify"`, `send_ready: false`, and recommend a separate nurture/requalification workflow.

## Step 1: Gather Follow-Up Context

Before generating any sequence, collect the following information. If not provided, ask the user:

1. **Prospect name** and **company**
2. **Previous interaction type**: Meeting, Demo, Proposal, Went Silent (Ghost), or Long-Term Nurture
3. **Date of last interaction**
4. **Key discussion points** from the last interaction (at least 3 specifics)
5. **Prospect's stated pain points** or goals
6. **Next step that was agreed upon** (if any)
7. **Prospect's role and seniority level** (affects tone and content)
8. **Deal stage**: Early exploration, Active evaluation, Near decision, Stalled
9. **Prospect temperature**: Hot (actively engaged), Warm (interested but slow), Cool (disengaged), Cold (ghosted)
10. **Your product/service** and the specific solution discussed

If previous analysis files exist in the working directory (PROSPECT-ANALYSIS.md, COMPANY-RESEARCH.md, LEAD-QUALIFICATION.md, DECISION-MAKERS.md, OUTREACH-SEQUENCE.md), read them and automatically incorporate relevant findings into the follow-up context.

## Step 2: Select Follow-Up Scenario

Based on the previous interaction type, select the matching scenario from below. If the user does not specify, ask which scenario fits best.

---

### Scenario 4: Ghost Recovery (3 Emails)

Use this when: The prospect has stopped responding after previous engagement.

**Email 1 — Pattern Interrupt** (Send: 7 days after last unanswered email)

- End with genuine goodwill — wish them well with a specific reference to their business or goals
- Length: 40-60 words

---

### Scenario 5: Nurture Sequence (Ongoing Monthly)

Use this when: The prospect is a good fit but not ready to buy now. Stay top of mind without being annoying.

Generate 6 monthly emails. Each email must be genuinely useful standalone content — the prospect should be glad they received it even if they never buy.

**Monthly Email Pattern** (Send: Once per month, same day of month)
- Alternate between these content types each month:
  1. **Industry Insight**: Share a trend, data point, or analysis relevant to their industry
  2. **Resource Share**: Article, tool, template, or guide they would find useful (does not need to be your content)
  3. **Case Study**: Brief success story from a company in their space
  4. **Thought Leadership**: Your unique perspective on a challenge in their industry
  5. **Event/Content Invite**: Webinar, podcast, report, or event invitation
  6. **Personal Check-In**: Genuine, brief check-in referencing something specific about their business

- Each nurture email must:
  - Have a subject line that provides value on its own (not "Checking in" or "Quick update")
  - Be under 80 words
  - Provide value with zero sales pitch
  - Include ONE subtle relevance tie-back (one sentence max)
  - End with a low-pressure CTA: "Worth a look" or "Thought you'd find this interesting" — never "Let's schedule a call"

---

## Step 3: Multi-Channel Integration

For each email in the selected sequence, also generate the following companion touchpoints:

### LinkedIn Touchpoints

For each email in the sequence, generate a corresponding LinkedIn action to be taken 1 day before or after the email:

- **Before Email 1**: View their LinkedIn profile (no message — just visibility)
- **After Email 1**: Like or comment on one of their recent LinkedIn posts (generate a specific, thoughtful comment based on the post content — not generic like "Great post!")
- **Before Email 2**: Share a relevant article and tag the prospect or their company (if appropriate)
- **After Email 3+**: Send a LinkedIn message that is SHORT (2-3 sentences max), conversational, and references the email topic without repeating it

LinkedIn message format:
```
Hey [First Name] — [One sentence referencing shared context or their recent activity]. [One sentence with the core message or question]. [No formal sign-off]
```

### Phone Call Scripts

Generate a 30-second voicemail script for two key moments in the sequence:

**Voicemail Script Template:**
```
Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from [Your Company].
[One sentence — the reason for calling, tied to a specific conversation point].
[One sentence — the value or new information you're sharing].
I'll send you a quick email with details — look for it from [your email].
Talk soon.
```

Rules for voicemail scripts:
- Never exceed 30 seconds when read aloud (approximately 75 words)
- Speak in a natural, conversational tone — not scripted-sounding
- Reference ONE specific thing from a previous conversation
- Always point them to the companion email for details
- Do NOT ask them to call back — reduce friction

### SMS/Text Templates

Generate text message templates for warm leads only (prospects who have engaged at least twice). SMS should only be used if the prospect has opted in to text communication.

**SMS Template Rules:**
- Maximum 2 sentences
- Casual, conversational tone
- Must provide value or ask a simple question
- Never include links (they look spammy via text)
- Always identify yourself: "Hey [Name], it's [Your Name] from [Company]."

Generate 2-3 SMS templates appropriate for the selected scenario.

## Step 4: Cadence Recommendations

Based on the deal stage and prospect temperature, recommend the optimal cadence:

### Cadence Matrix

| Prospect Temperature | Deal Stage: Early | Deal Stage: Active | Deal Stage: Near Decision | Deal Stage: Stalled |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| **Hot** | Every 2-3 days | Every 2 days | Daily touchpoints OK | Every 3-4 days |
| **Warm** | Every 4-5 days | Every 3-4 days | Every 2-3 days | Every 5-7 days |
| **Cool** | Every 7 days | Every 5-7 days | Every 4-5 days | Every 10-14 days |
| **Cold/Ghost** | Every 10-14 days | Every 7-10 days | Every 5-7 days | Every 14-21 days |

### Channel Cadence Rules

- **Email**: Primary channel for all follow-ups. Every touchpoint in the sequence should have an email.
- **LinkedIn**: Secondary channel. Use 1-2 days offset from email. Never send a LinkedIn message and email on the same day.
- **Phone**: Use sparingly. Maximum 2 calls per sequence. Best used after Email 2 and before the final email.
- **SMS**: Use only for hot/warm leads who have opted in. Maximum 1-2 texts per sequence. Best for time-sensitive confirmations or quick check-ins.

### Time-of-Day Recommendations

- **C-Suite / Executives**: Tuesday-Thursday, 7:00-8:00 AM or 5:00-6:00 PM (before/after their meeting blocks)
- **VPs / Directors**: Tuesday-Thursday, 9:00-10:00 AM or 2:00-3:00 PM
- **Managers / ICs**: Tuesday-Thursday, 10:00-11:00 AM or 1:00-2:00 PM
- **Avoid**: Monday mornings (inbox overload), Friday afternoons (checked out), weekends (unprofessional)

## Step 5: Breakup Email Best Practices

When generating any breakup or final email in a sequence, follow these rules:

1. **Be respectful and genuine**: Never guilt-trip, passive-aggressive, or sarcastic. The prospect owes you nothing.
2. **Acknowledge reality**: "I've reached out a few times" is honest. "I've been trying to reach you" sounds desperate.
3. **Leave the door open**: Always make it easy for them to re-engage later with zero awkwardness.
4. **Create subtle FOMO**: Use factual scarcity — implementation bandwidth, pricing changes, client slots — never manufactured urgency.
5. **End on a positive note**: Wish them well with something specific to their situation.
6. **Keep it the shortest email in the sequence**: Breakup emails should be 40-60 words maximum.
7. **Never burn bridges**: This prospect may become a customer in 6-12 months, refer someone, or change companies.

```

---

## Rules and Constraints

1. **Every email must add NEW value.** Never send a "just checking in" or "bumping this to the top of your inbox" email. If there is nothing new to say, do not send.
2. **Reference specific conversation points.** Generic follow-ups get deleted. Every email must reference something specific from the previous interaction.
3. **One clear next step per email.** Never give multiple CTAs. One email = one ask.
4. **Under 100 words per email.** Busy people do not read long follow-ups. Respect their time.
5. **Appropriate urgency.** Urgency must be real (timeline, capacity, pricing) — never manufactured or manipulative.
6. **Personalization is mandatory.** Use the prospect's name, company name, specific challenges, and conversation points. No [PLACEHOLDER] brackets in the final output.
7. **Professional but human tone.** Write like a helpful human, not a sales bot. Contractions are fine. Overly formal language is not.
8. **No manipulation tactics.** No fake scarcity, no guilt trips, no "I noticed you opened my email" tracking callouts.
9. **Respect the prospect's time and intelligence.** They know you want to sell. Be direct about your intent while providing genuine value.
10. **If previous analysis files exist**, incorporate their data. Do not ask the user to repeat information that is already available in PROSPECT-ANALYSIS.md, COMPANY-RESEARCH.md, or other output files in the working directory.
