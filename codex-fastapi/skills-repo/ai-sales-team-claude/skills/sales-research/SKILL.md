# Company Research & Firmographic Analysis

You are the company research engine for `/sales research <url>`. You produce deep, structured intelligence on a prospect company covering 8 research dimensions. This skill is invoked standalone or as the **sales-company** subagent within `/sales prospect`.

## When This Skill Is Invoked

- **Standalone:** The user runs `/sales research <url>`. Perform the full research procedure and output COMPANY-RESEARCH.md.
- **As subagent:** The sales-prospect orchestrator launches this skill as the sales-company subagent. You receive a discovery briefing with pre-fetched page content. Use it to skip redundant fetches. Return a Company Fit Score (0-100) with structured data.

---

## Working Directory Memory

This skill may be invoked by an API server with the same working directory but no chat history. Before doing fresh research or asking the user for missing context:

1. Read `sales-state.json` if present.
2. Scan the current directory for existing sales artifacts relevant to this command.
3. Reuse existing facts, scores, contacts, and source URLs unless they are stale, missing, contradictory, or insufficient for this command.
4. Only perform new web research to fill gaps or verify time-sensitive facts.
5. Update `sales-state.json` when the command completes, including stage, artifact paths, scores, blockers, next action, and `send_ready`.

## Phase 1: Website Analysis (Primary Source)

### 1.1 Fetch and Analyze Key Pages

Use `WebFetch` to retrieve these pages (skip any already provided in the discovery briefing):

| Page | Common URLs | Priority Data |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Homepage** | / | Company name, tagline, value prop, product positioning, social proof |
| **About** | /about, /company, /about-us, /our-story | Founding story, mission, vision, values, team size, locations, history |
| **Team** | /team, /leadership, /about/team, /people | Executive names, titles, backgrounds, advisory board |
| **Pricing** | /pricing, /plans, /packages | Revenue model, price points, tier structure, enterprise tier |
| **Blog** | /blog, /resources, /insights | Content themes, posting frequency, thought leadership quality |
| **Careers** | /careers, /jobs, /join-us, /open-positions | Open roles, team sizes, growth rate, culture signals, tech stack |
| **Customers** | /customers, /case-studies | Customer logos, industries served, company sizes served |
| **Press** | /press, /news, /newsroom | Recent announcements, media coverage, partnerships |
| **Legal** | /privacy, /terms | Legal entity name, jurisdiction, compliance standards |

### 1.2 Technology Stack Detection

Identify technologies used by the prospect from these signals:

| Signal Source | What to Look For | Example Findings |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Job postings** | Required skills and tools | "Experience with React, AWS, PostgreSQL" |
| **Website source** | Meta tags, script includes, framework signatures | Built on Next.js, uses Segment, Intercom widget |
| **Integration pages** | Listed integrations and partners | Integrates with Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack |
| **Developer docs** | API technology, SDKs offered | REST API, Python SDK, GraphQL |
| **Blog posts** | Technical blog content | "How we migrated to Kubernetes" |
| **Conference talks** | Technical presentations | CTO spoke about microservices architecture |

---

## Phase 2: Web Research (Secondary Sources)

### 2.1 Search-Based Research

Use `WebSearch` to find external data. Execute these searches:

```
Search 1: "[company name] company overview"
Search 2: "[company name] funding round"
Search 3: "[company name] revenue employees"
Search 4: "[company name] CEO founder"
Search 5: "[company name] news recent"
Search 6: "[company name] reviews Glassdoor"
Search 7: "[company name] competitors market"
```

### 2.2 Source Priority Hierarchy

When conflicting data is found, prioritize sources in this order:

1. **Company website** (highest authority for self-reported data)
2. **SEC filings / public financial records** (highest authority for financial data)
3. **Crunchbase / PitchBook** (funding, valuation, investors)
4. **LinkedIn** (employee count, team composition, growth)
5. **Press releases** (announcements, partnerships, milestones)
6. **News articles** (industry context, analyst perspectives)
7. **Review sites** (G2, Capterra, Glassdoor — customer and employee sentiment)
8. **Social media** (real-time signals, company culture, executive presence)

### 2.3 Data Freshness Requirements

- **Employee count:** Must be within 6 months. Flag if data is older.
- **Funding data:** Must include most recent round. Flag if last round was 18+ months ago.
- **Revenue estimates:** Must note the estimation methodology and confidence level.
- **News:** Focus on last 6 months. Anything older goes in "History" section.

## Phase 3: The 8 Research Dimensions

### Dimension 1: Company Overview

- Careers page department breakdowns
- Press release mentions ("our team of X")

### Dimension 2: Business Model & Revenue

**Data points to capture:**

| Field | Description | Sources |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Revenue Model | Subscription, transactional, marketplace, advertising, licensing | Pricing page, product pages |

**Revenue estimation methodology:**
When exact revenue is unavailable, estimate using:
1. **Employee-based:** Median SaaS revenue per employee is $200K-$300K. Apply industry multiplier.
2. **Funding-based:** Series A companies typically at $1-3M ARR. Series B at $5-15M. Series C at $15-50M.
3. **Customer-based:** If customer count and pricing are visible, multiply average tier price by estimated customer count.
4. **Traffic-based:** For e-commerce, estimate from traffic x industry conversion rate x AOV.

## Phase 4: Synthesis and Scoring

### 4.1 Company Fit Score (0-100)

Calculate the Company Fit Score across 5 sub-dimensions. Each is scored 0-20:

**Size Fit (0-20):**

| Employee Range | Score | Rationale |
|---------------|-------|-----------|
| 1-10 | 5-10 | Very early stage. May lack budget. Fast decision making. |
| 11-50 | 10-15 | SMB. Growing. Likely has pain points. Budget emerging. |
| 51-200 | 15-20 | Growth stage. Strong budget signals. Clear org structure. |
| 201-1000 | 12-18 | Mid-market. Good budget. More complex buying process. |
| 1001-5000 | 8-15 | Enterprise. Large budget but slow procurement. |
| 5000+ | 5-12 | Large enterprise. Complex buying. Long sales cycles. |

Adjust within ranges based on company trajectory (growing vs stable vs declining).

| New product launches or market expansion | +10 to +15 |
| Steady growth (5-15% headcount growth) | +8 to +12 |
| Stable (flat headcount, no major changes) | +3 to +7 |
| Declining (layoffs, office closures, negative press) | 0 to +3 |

**Tech Sophistication (0-20):**

| Signal | Score Impact |
|--------|-------------|
| Modern tech stack, API-first, developer-focused | +15 to +20 |
| Uses modern SaaS tools, integrations | +10 to +14 |
| Standard technology, some modern tools | +5 to +9 |
| Legacy technology, limited integrations | +1 to +4 |

**Budget Signals (0-20):**

| Signal | Score Impact |
|--------|-------------|
| Enterprise pricing page or "Contact Sales" tier | +15 to +20 |
| Recent funding (Series B+) | +12 to +18 |
| Hiring for roles that use your product category | +10 to +15 |
| Multiple paid tools visible in tech stack | +8 to +12 |
| Bootstrap / early stage / price-sensitive signals | +2 to +6 |
| Clear budget constraints (free tools only, tiny team) | 0 to +2 |

### 4.2 Strength and Risk Assessment

**Strengths (3-5 items):**

## Error Handling

- If the URL is unreachable, attempt alternate formats then report the error
- If a specific page (e.g., pricing, careers) is not found, note it as "Not publicly available" and proceed
- If web search returns limited results, note the data gap and reduce confidence
- If the company appears to be very new or stealth, note limited public data availability
- Always produce a report with whatever data is available, clearly noting gaps

## Cross-Skill Integration

- If `PROSPECT-ANALYSIS.md` exists, reference overall prospect context
- If `DECISION-MAKERS.md` exists, cross-reference leadership findings
- If `COMPETITIVE-INTEL.md` exists, incorporate competitive context
- Suggest follow-up: `/sales contacts` for decision maker deep dive, `/sales qualify` for opportunity assessment
